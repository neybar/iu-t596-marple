## Malware Data Report

This data was gathered from Github.  Show here are some interesting data points on the kinds of projects that have been worked on as it relates to Malware.  The data here can be used in AI applications in a variety of ways:

* Finding repos where new Malware attacks are being developed
* Leveraging projects where people are mitigating Malware attacks
* Training data for Malware signatures
* And much more

Malware protection in the Fintech industry is esspecially important because so much vital data is flowing.  PII data for customers is stored in Databases, processed in application servers, and transits between various services and networking gear.  PCI (credit card) data is also being handled.  Not only is PCI data critical to keep private, but it can come with severe penalties if it is discovered that a Fintech company didn't do enough to protect it's data.

Malware can attack nearly every point in the pathway between a customer, business, b2b, and in data storage.  There are targeted attack malware as well as general attack vectors.  The viruses, trojan horses, worms and every other sort of malware need to be protected against.

Knowing where to look for data on malware can be hard to do.  The developers of most malware try to keep it hidden until it is ready to do damage.  Using Github as a data source is intriguing because it leverages a whole community that is actively trying to classify, scan, protect, and prevent a whole variety of malware.  Being able to identify the projects that are of most value is one area where AI can really shine.  It has the ability to sift through all the data and provide insights that we humans might not be able to see, or fo find in an efficient amount of time.
